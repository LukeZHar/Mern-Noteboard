# Mern-Noteboard — MERN notes app

A minimal, production-ready notes application built with React (Vite), Node + Express, and MongoDB. It supports creating, editing, and deleting notes and uses Upstash for a Redis-backed rate limiting layer. The app can be deployed as a single service (backend serves the static build) or with the frontend and backend hosted separately.
